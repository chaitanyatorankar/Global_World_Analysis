# Global_World_Analysis

# Project Description

This project analyzes a dataset of 195 countries with 35 socio-economic and demographic indicators such as GDP, population, education, health, CO₂ emissions, and unemployment. The aim is to clean, explore, and visualize the data to uncover global development patterns, correlations, and insights across different regions.
